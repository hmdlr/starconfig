## Starphish: Your Personal Phishing Guardian

Recognizing authenticity in unfamiliar contexts: that's the key challenge of phishing detection. Like a user, an anti-phishing system struggles to determine the legitimacy of an unknown authentication page. Is this trustworthy or is it a phishing attempt?

It's hard to verify the legitimacy of a page without some basic understanding of the brand's legitimate URL or webpage design. That's why we developed Starphish to mimic a kind of "familiarity" or knowledge base. It's like the knowledge a human user has when they are familiar with a brand's URL or logo. This insight led us to develop the configuration system. Here, rule sets create a profile for each brand, helping to determine authenticity. This approach allows Starphish to identify phishing attempts with personalization and accuracy.

### The Power of Configurations

The "configurations" are the secret sauce of Starphish. They are user-defined collections of "rules." Each rule includes the brand's metadata, a screenshot of its authentication webpage, the webpage's title, and its favicon. This data creates a detailed profile that Starphish uses to validate websites and detect potential phishing attacks. Users can create and manage different active configurations according to their needs, enhancing the protection offered.

This flexibility is vital. Users often interact with various brands across multiple industries, each with unique phishing risks. Starphish includes pre-built public configurations to protect against the most common phishing targets. These primarily safeguard the banking and social media sectors. These sectors are frequent targets of phishing attempts, so these default options provide critical protection.

Remember, a configuration can have multiple rules, and a rule can belong to one or more configurations. It's a many-to-many relationship. This approach offers greater flexibility and increased protection, making Starphish an effective shield against phishing.
