## Personalized phishing protection

---

Starphish benefits from a **flexible configuration system**, allowing users to register and manage trusted brands of their own liking.

Let's say you only access `Bank X`, browse `Store Y` and talk on `Site Z`. These could be world-famous platforms, or some obscure, local
companies.

For a protection custom tailored for you, you could create a **configuration**, called _Personal_, in which you would
include all 3 platforms. This allows Starphish to get to "know" and recognize the brand, its authenticity, sort of like a fingerprint
of the website. Now, no other service could pretend to be any of those brands.

Obviously, there are some public configurations, containing some of the most popular services, but the magic of Starphish
lies in the extent of your personalization.

## Comprehensive scan

---

When a scan is requested via the extension, a lot the website's underlying code is analyzed. The _URL_, _HTML_ and
page's public records are simply not enough. We make use of the Debugger API in order to get a better look into the
page's intentions.

Even without any active configurations, a plain Starphish scan should recognize phishing intent for most malicious
websites.
